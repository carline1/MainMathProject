This is a project on mathematical statistics in C#, which can build a scatter plot from the input data, calculate the correlation and determination coefficient, test hypotheses about the presence of a close relationship between the input data, calculate the equation of the regression line, output graphs of the regression line, analyze the residuals, depending on the number entered by the user, extrapolate or interpolate with the selected level of significance.
